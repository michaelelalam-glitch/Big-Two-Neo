# Flow 01: App Launch & Sign-In Screen
# Validates: App launches correctly, sign-in screen renders with expected UI
# Tags: smoke, auth
#
# This is the most basic E2E test — verifies the app boots and displays
# the authentication screen for unauthenticated users.

appId: com.big2mobile.app
tags:
  - smoke
  - auth
---
# Step 1: Launch with clean state to ensure unauthenticated
- launchApp:
    clearState: true

# Step 2: Wait for app to fully load (splash screen → sign-in)
- extendedWaitUntil:
    visible: "Welcome to Big2"
    timeout: 15000

# Step 3: Verify sign-in screen content
- assertVisible: "Welcome to Big2"
- assertVisible: "Sign in to play with friends and track your progress"

# Step 4: Verify sign-in buttons are present
- assertVisible: "Sign in with Google"

# Step 5: Verify footer
- assertVisible:
    text: "Terms of Service"
    optional: true

# Step 6: Take screenshot for visual regression
- takeScreenshot: "01_sign_in_screen"
