# Flow 01: App Launch & Sign-In Screen
# Validates: App launches correctly, sign-in screen renders with expected UI
# Tags: smoke, auth, ci
#
# This is the most basic E2E test — verifies the app boots and displays
# the authentication screen for unauthenticated users.
# Runs in CI without authentication (ci tag).
#
# Uses testID-based selectors (id:) for reliable matching in Release builds.
# Text matching can fail in Release/Hermes due to accessibility tree differences.

# Step 1: Launch with clean state to ensure unauthenticated
- launchApp:
    clearState: true

# Step 2: Wait for sign-in screen to load (testID on SafeAreaView container)
- extendedWaitUntil:
    visible:
      id: "sign-in-screen"
    timeout: 45000

# Step 3: Verify sign-in screen content via testIDs
- assertVisible:
    id: "sign-in-title"

- assertVisible:
    id: "sign-in-subtitle"

# Step 4: Verify Google sign-in button is present
- assertVisible:
    id: "google-sign-in-button"

# Step 5: Verify footer text
- assertVisible:
    id: "sign-in-footer"

# Step 6: Take screenshot for visual regression
- takeScreenshot: "01_sign_in_screen"
