fix: address Copilot Round 3 review comments

- Broaden One Card Left error matching in executeBotTurn circuit breaker
  to also catch "Cannot pass" + "1 card left" from pass() rewrite
- Fix 5-card combo sort to strict weak ordering (compare both directions)
  to avoid non-deterministic results on ties
- Fix stale closure in useGameStateManager subscribe callback by tracking
  prevPlayerIndex in a local variable instead of reading stale gameState
- Reset init guards (isInitializedRef, initializedRoomRef) on catch so
  re-renders can retry initialization after transient failures
