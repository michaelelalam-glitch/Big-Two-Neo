fix: multiplayer bot One Card Left turn order mismatch

Root cause: Bot AI used anticlockwise turn order [3,2,0,1] (for local
games) to detect the One Card Left rule, but the multiplayer server uses
sequential turn order (current+1)%numPlayers. This caused bots to miss
that the next player had 1 card, leading to server-rejected passes shown
as error alerts to the human player.

Fix: Add nextPlayerIndex to BotPlayOptions. useBotCoordinator now computes
the next active player using sequential order (matching server Edge
Functions) and passes it to the bot AI. When provided, bot AI uses it
directly instead of computing from anticlockwise turn order. Local games
still use anticlockwise order via findNextActivePlayer fallback.
